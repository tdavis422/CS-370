Current/Emerging Trends in CS
**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
The work that I performed on this project was to build a Deep Quality Network to solve a puzzle. The puzzle was to help a pirate find the best path to reach the treasure at the end. I was given most of the code, the only part I had to build myself was the training agent to be able to teach the pirate the best and shortest route to the treasure.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists do many different things. Software development, IT, risk analysis, web design, and many other technological variations. Computer scientists matter because if there was no one working to build websites or messaging platforms, then there might not be any form of the internet.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
I first analyze the problem, then I sadly build many different prototypes of solutions to determine the best one for each action. I am one that will try to find many solutions to one problem instead of one solution for each problem due to how I was last taught at my last college.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
My responsibilities to the end user and the organization is to ensure that anything created is not in violation of any laws or regulations, and that it does not violate any person's rights in their own country or any of our rights here in the United States.
